# Online Multiplayer Bullshit Bingo

Hey guys. Some people on the Internet talk far too much bullshit when the day is long and like to repeat this constantly and as often as possible.  So it would be great if you could make a funny game out of it with your friends.

For this reason the Bullshit Bingo is developed here.

# Rules
The game is divided into 2 phases:

###### - Collecting phase:
  The players can either enter their own words in the fields, or choose from a list. If a player can't think of 25 words, he can
  have the remaining fields filled automatically.

###### - Bingo Phase:
  This is where the actual game begins. Each time a word that the player previously
  falls, the player clicks on the respective field and it is marked as said. The first player to have 5 in a row wins.

At the moment the game is very trustful, so look for a good buddy to play with. As long as there's no AI that can understand the bullshit, there's no other way. I'll write more tools bit by bit, which will help you a little bit and who knows, maybe one day the software behind it will be really intelligent.

Once the game is in a playable state, I will make it available on a website :)
